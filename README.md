# reversi

Using your favorite language, solve the following programming quiz:

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example:**
```
Input: "the sky is blue", 
Output: "blue is sky the".
```
**Notes:**
- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
Make sure you have unit tests that test your output
